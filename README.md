# BruteForce
Ä° are going to be Simulating a Brute Force Attack using integers.

The way it is going to work is, we will be taking an integer from the user and calculating its hash hence during a real brute force attack the hacker only know the password hash. 

Then we will go through all possible integers, calculating the hash of each of them and comparing it to the inputs' hash, until we eventually (and hopefully) find a match!
